# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Sports
IPL is a highly popular cricket tournament in India, and in this analysis, we will be examining various aspects of the tournament using Python programming language.
To begin, we import the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization. We utilize libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to efficiently handle the data and generate insightful visualizations. Additionally, we import plotly, which allows us to create interactive and engaging plots.
Moving on, we load the dataset files 'matches_.csv' and 'deliveries_.csv' into pandas DataFrames. The 'matches_df' DataFrame contains information about the matches, while the 'score_df' DataFrame contains detailed scoring data for each match.
Once the data is loaded, we start by examining its structure and properties. We use the 'info()' function to obtain a summary of the dataset, including the column names and data types. This helps us understand the structure of the data. Additionally, we use the 'isnull().sum()' function to check for any missing values in the dataset.
Next, we perform data cleaning to address any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the data. For example, we may encounter different team names for the same team or variations in city and venue names. By standardizing and replacing these values, we ensure data consistency and accuracy in our analysis.
Moving further into the analysis, we explore various aspects of the IPL dataset. Firstly, we identify the team that won by the maximum runs and the team that won by the maximum wickets. This provides insights into the dominance of certain teams in different scenarios. Similarly, we identify the team that won by the minimum runs and the team that won by the minimum wickets.
Additionally, we analyze the distribution of matches across different seasons using a countplot. This allows us to identify which season had the highest number of games, providing an overview of the tournament's growth and popularity over the years.
This code shows the number of matches played in each venue using a bar plot. This gives us an idea of the distribution of matches across different stadiums.
Next, the code showcases the number of matches played by each team, providing insights into the participation of different teams in the IPL. The plot reveals that Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore have played the most matches.
Moving on, we presents the number of wins per team, indicating the success of each team in the IPL. Mumbai Indians have the highest number of wins, followed by Chennai Super Kings.
Furthermore, the code displays the champions of each season, showcasing the team that emerged as the winner in each year of the IPL.
Next, we explores the toss decisions made by teams. It visualizes the percentage of toss decisions to bat or field first, with around 61% of the decisions being to field first. The plot also demonstrates how the trend has shifted over time, with teams increasingly opting to field first in recent seasons.
Then we examines the impact of winning the toss on the match outcome. It presents a bar chart comparing the total number of wins by each team with the number of toss wins. This gives us an idea of whether winning the toss has a significant effect on winning the match.
Additionally, the code analyzes the success rate of teams batting second. It calculates the win percentage for teams batting second and shows that they have won 53.7% of the matches.
Moving on to individual player analysis, the code identifies the top players of the match based on the number of times they were awarded the "Player of the Match." Chris Gayle emerges as the top player, having received the award multiple times.
The code also highlights the top umpires in the IPL based on the number of matches they officiated.
 Now we shifts our focus to batting analysis. It identifies the top run-scorers in the IPL, with Virat Kohli leading the chart. It also showcases the batsmen with the most boundaries and sixes, where S Dhawan and Chris Gayle dominate the respective categories. Furthermore, it identifies the batsmen with the highest number of dot balls, and the percentage distribution of dot balls for batsmen who have faced more than 200 balls.
Now ,we go for bowlers analysis,
the code identifies the bowlers who have bowled the most number of balls in the IPL. It groups the data by bowler and counts the number of balls bowled. The top 10 bowlers with the highest number of balls bowled are then displayed using a bar plot. Interestingly, Harbhajan Singh emerges as the bowler who has bowled the most number of balls in IPL matches.
Moving on, we determines the bowler with the highest number of dot balls. Dot balls refer to the deliveries where no runs are scored. Again, the data is grouped by bowler, and the count of dot balls is calculated. The top 10 bowlers with the most dot balls are visualized using another bar plot. Harbhajan Singh holds the record for the most dot balls, followed by SL Malinga and B Kumar.
Now, let's explore the bowlers who have conceded the most extras in IPL matches. Extras include runs scored through wide deliveries, no-balls, and byes. The code groups the data by bowler and counts the number of deliveries that resulted in extras. The top 10 bowlers with the highest number of extras conceded are presented using a bar plot. Malinga leads the chart with 221 extra runs, followed by Pravin Kumar.
Next, we analyzes the top 10 bowlers in terms of wickets taken. It excludes run-outs from the dismissal count and calculates the total wickets for each bowler. The data is then sorted in descending order based on the wickets taken. A line plot is used to visualize the top 10 bowlers and their respective wicket counts.
Moving on to the best bowling performances in a single match, the code considers the top 10 bowlers based on wickets taken and runs conceded. It calculates the runs per wicket for each bowler and combines it with the wickets taken. The resulting data is then plotted using a combination of markers and lines to showcase the performances of the bowlers.
Shifting the focus to fielding, the code determines the top 10 best fielders in the IPL based on the number of catches taken. It counts the occurrences of each fielder and presents the data using a bar plot.
Lastly, we investigates the most common dismissal types in the IPL. It displays a count plot showcasing the frequency of different dismissal types, such as caught, bowled, and hit wicket. It is interesting to note that caught is the most common dismissal type, followed by bowled, with hit wicket being relatively rare.
 Thank you.
